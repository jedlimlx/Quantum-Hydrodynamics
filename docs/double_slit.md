# Interference and Diffraction
Some of the quantum-like effects the droplets can exhibit are 
interference and diffraction.



Diffraction is when waves pass through a small slit. The wave will
tend to spread out after passing through the slit, following a certain 
pattern. It is commonly demonstrated in schools using light 
rays shot through a thin slit, where the light rays will spread out
and form a unique pattern on a screen, known as a diffraction pattern.

Early on, diffraction was only observed with waves, such as light
and sound. However, in 1924, Louis de Broglie made the bold claim 
that particles could behave like waves, in the same way that Planck 
and Einstein hypothesized that waves, such as light, can behave
like particles. His claims were not backed by direct experimental
evidence when he published his thesis, but he was proven right 
when scientists found that electrons can also be diffracted!
