# Quantum Tunneling
In quantum mechanics, quantum tunneling refers to a particle that tunnels through an energy barrier completely at 
random. Normally, in classical mechanics, which describes the physics in our daily lives, a ball can not roll past a
hill without having enough energy to reach the tip of the hill. However, in quantum mechanics, when we shoot an electron 
at a potential barrier, which is an energy barrier for the electron. Normally the electron would be stopped by the 
barrier and bounce back. However, with some small but finite probability, the electron can go right through the
potential barrier, resulting in the phenomenon that is named quantum tunneling.

Interestingly, the droplets can exhibit behaviours similar to regular quantum tunneling. As it turns out, by fully 
submerging a piece of material(which can be plastic, metal, or anything that is solid) into the silicon oil, we create 
the barrier that the droplet would bounce off of most of the time, but is able to pass through in some rare occurrences. 
Now we can go into the details of this phenomenon.

## Wall
When waves travel from a deeper location to a shallower location, the waves slow down, which results in refraction and
partial reflection of the wave. Since the droplet and the waves affect each other and the piece of material creates a 
shallow region in the silicon oil, this results in a barrier at the "wall", which prevents the droplet from going past 
it and instead bounces back.

## Tunneling
So how is quantum tunneling related to this? Experiments done by Eddi and his team have shown that there are random
occasions where the droplet actually can go over the "wall". This is similar to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling.
The probability of a droplet going over the wall has been found to be decrease exponentially with increasing width of 
the "wall". This is exactly analogous to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling. The probability of the particle
passing the energy barrier also decreases exponentially with increasing width of the energy barrier.
