# Quantum Tunnelling
In quantum mechanics, quantum tunnelling refers to a particle that tunnels through an energy barrier completely at 
random.

Looking at the short animation above, we can see that normally, in classical mechanics, which describes the physics in 
our daily lives, a ball cannot roll past a hill without having enough energy to reach the tip of the hill. We call the 
hill an energy barrier as the ball needs to possess a certain amount of energy to cross it.

Looking at another short animation above, we can see in quantum mechanics, when we shoot an electron at a potential 
barrier, which acts as an energy barrier for the electron, we would expect the electron to be stopped by the potential 
barrier. Indeed, that is what is observed most of the time when such experiments are done.

However, something similar to the short animation above can happen in real life at quantum scale. Due to the quirks of 
quantum mechanics, sometimes the electron that is supposed to be stopped at the potential barrier, tunnels to the other side of 
the potential barrier. This means that the electron had just managed to go straight through the potential barrier. This 
is something that would have been impossible in classical mechanics but has a small but finite probability to happen in 
quantum mechanics. Thus, this is named the quantum tunnelling phenomenon in quantum mechanics, signifying that the 
electron had "dug" a "tunnel" to go past the energy barrier.

Interestingly, the droplets can exhibit behaviours almost identical to regular quantum tunneling as shown above. As it 
turns out, by fully submerging a piece of material (which can be plastic, metal, or anything that is solid) into the 
small pool of silicon oil, we have managed to create the energy barrier, which you can imagine as a wall, that the 
droplet would bounce off most of the time, but is able to pass through in some rare circumstances. Now we can go into
the details of this behaviour and why it is very similar to regular quantum tunneling.

## Wall
So firstly, we will go over how fully submerging a piece of material would cause the formation of a "wall" for the oil 
droplet. In order to understand that, let's first look at the equation below. 
$$ c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}\tanh{hk}} $$
This equation describes the wave velocity of the wave, where c is the wave speed, g is Earth's gravitational constant, k
is the wavenumber and h is the depth that the wave is traveling above. In our scenario, k and g would stay constant, 
thus we would have the following relation.
$$ c \propto \sqrt{\tanh{hk}} $$
When we fully submerge a piece of material, the depth of the water decreases, which means a decrease in h in the 
equation above, thus a decrease in c, which is the wave speed. Whenever the speed of a wave changes, it is always 
associated with refraction. When refraction is occurs, partial reflection almost always follows. Thus, the wave, 
which both influences and is influenced by the droplet, is partially reflected at where the piece of material is present 
at. Since the wave also influences the droplet, often the droplet would be bounced back at the location of the piece of 
material if it does not have sufficient kinetic energy to go over the area created by the material, thus creating a 
"wall" for the droplet.

## Similarity to Tunneling
So how is this phenomenon almost identical to quantum tunneling? Experiments have been done and the results have shown 
that the probability of a droplet going over a wall decreases exponentially with increasing width of the wall, 
which translates to increasing width of the energy barrier. This is exactly the same as the probability of an electron 
passing through a potential barrier, which also decreases exponentially with increasing width of the potential barrier, 
which is also the energy barrier. Another similarity is that there has been no pattern observed in the conditions 
required for the droplet to pass over the "wall" if it does not have the kinetic energy required for it to go over the 
wall. It is completely probabilistic. The two main characteristics of quantum tunneling are both observed in this 
phenomenon, thus we can conclude that this phenomenon is almost identical to quantum tunneling.
