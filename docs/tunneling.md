# Quantum Tunnelling
In quantum mechanics, quantum tunnelling refers to a particle that tunnels through an energy barrier completely at 
random. Normally, in classical mechanics, which describes the physics in our daily lives, a ball can not roll past a
hill without having enough energy to reach the tip of the hill. We call the hill an energy barrier as the ball needs to 
possess a certain amount of energy to cross it. In quantum mechanics, when we shoot an electron at a potential barrier, 
which acts as an energy barrier for the electron, we would expect the electron to be stopped at the potential barrier. 
Indeed, that is what is observed most of the time when such experiments are done. However, due to the quirks of quantum
mechanics, sometimes we can see that the electron that is supposed to be stopped at the potential barrier, on the other
side of the potential barrier. Which means that the electron had just managed to go straight through the potential 
barrier. This is something that would have been impossible in classical mechanics but has a small but finite probability 
to happen in quantum mechanics. Thus, this is named the quantum tunnelling phenomenon in quantum mechanics, signifying 
that the electron had "dug" a "tunnel" to go past the energy barrier.

Interestingly, the droplets can exhibit behaviours almost identical to regular quantum tunneling. As it turns out, by 
fully submerging a piece of material (which can be plastic, metal, or anything that is solid) into the small pool of 
silicon oil, we have managed to create the energy barrier, which you can imagine as a wall, that the droplet would 
bounce off of most of the time, but is able to pass through in some rare circumstances. Now we can go into the details 
of this behaviour and why it is very similar to regular quantum tunneling.

## Wall
So firstly, I will go over how fully submerging a piece of material would cause the formation of a "wall" for the oil 
droplet. In order to understand that, let's first look at the equation below. 
$$ c = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}\tanh{hk}} $$
This equation describes the wave velocity of the wave, where c is the wave speed, g is Earth's gravitational constant, k
is the wavenumber and h is the depth that the wave is traveling above. In our scenario, k and g would stay constant, 
thus we would have the following relation.
$$ c \propto \sqrt{\tanh{hk}} $$
As you can see, as h decreases, c decreases, which means that the speed has decreased. And when we fully submerge a 
piece of material, the h decreases. Whenever the speed of a wave changes, it is often associated with refraction. And 
when refraction is concerned, partial reflection almost always follows. Thus, the wave, which both influences and is 
influenced by the droplet, is partially reflected at where the piece of material is present at. Since the wave also 
influences the droplet, often the droplet would be bounced back at the location of the piece of material without enough 
kinetic energy, thus creating a "wall" for the droplet.

## Similarity to Tunneling
So how is quantum tunneling related to this? Experiments done by Eddi and his team have shown that there are random
occasions where the droplet actually can go over the "wall". This is similar to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling.
The probability of a droplet going over the wall has been found to be decrease exponentially with increasing width of 
the "wall". This is exactly analogous to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling. The probability of the particle
passing the energy barrier also decreases exponentially with increasing width of the energy barrier.
