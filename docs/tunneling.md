# Quantum Tunnelling
In quantum mechanics, quantum tunnelling refers to a particle that tunnels through an energy barrier completely at 
random. Normally, in classical mechanics, which describes the physics in our daily lives, a ball can not roll past a
hill without having enough energy to reach the tip of the hill. We call the hill an energy barrier as the ball requires 
a certain amount of energy to cross it. In quantum mechanics, when we shoot an electron at a potential barrier, which 
acts as an energy barrier for the electron, we would expect the electron to be stopped at the potential barrier. 
Indeed, that is what is observed most of the time when such experiments are done. However, due to the quirks of quantum
mechanics, sometimes we can see that the electron that is supposed to be stopped at the potential barrier, on the other
side of the potential barrier. Which means that the electron had just managed to go straight through the potential 
barrier. This is something that would have been impossible in classical mechanics but has a small but finite probability 
to happen in quantum mechanics. Thus, this is named the quantum tunnelling phenomenon in quantum mechanics, signifying 
that the electron had "dug" a "tunnel" to go through the energy barrier.

Interestingly, the droplets can exhibit behaviours similar to regular quantum tunneling. As it turns out, by fully 
submerging a piece of material(which can be plastic, metal, or anything that is solid) into the pool of silicon oil, we 
have managed to create the energy barrier that the droplet would bounce off of most of the time, but is able to pass 
through in some rare circumstances. Now we can go into the details of this behaviour and why it is very similar to 
regular quantum tunneling.

## Wall
When waves travel from a deeper location to a shallower location, the waves slow down, which results in refraction and
partial reflection of the wave. Since the droplet and the waves affect each other and the piece of material creates a 
shallow region in the silicon oil, this results in a barrier at the "wall", which prevents the droplet from going past 
it and instead bounces back.

## Similarity to Tunneling
So how is quantum tunneling related to this? Experiments done by Eddi and his team have shown that there are random
occasions where the droplet actually can go over the "wall". This is similar to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling.
The probability of a droplet going over the wall has been found to be decrease exponentially with increasing width of 
the "wall". This is exactly analogous to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling. The probability of the particle
passing the energy barrier also decreases exponentially with increasing width of the energy barrier.
