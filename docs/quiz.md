=== "Droplet Bouncing?"

    Why does the droplet get repelled by the liquid surface, allowing it to bounce? (By Jed) <br> <br>

    A. The air layer between the droplet and liquid surface is compressed, resulting in a restoring force that 
    pushes the droplet away from the surface <br>
    B. The droplet and liquid are electrostatically charged, resulting in a repulsive force <br>
    C. The vibrating liquid surface hits the droplet, exerting a normal force that pushes the droplet away from the surface <br>
