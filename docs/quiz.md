=== "Droplet Bouncing?"

    Why does the droplet get repelled by the liquid surface, allowing it to bounce? (By Jed) <br> <br>

    A. The air layer between the droplet and liquid surface is compressed, resulting in a restoring force that 
    pushes the droplet away from the surface <br>
    B. The droplet and liquid are electrostatically charged, resulting in a repulsive force <br>
    C. The vibrating liquid surface hits the droplet, exerting a normal force that pushes the droplet away from the surface <br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **A**. 

    Its not B because the droplet and liquid are not charged. Its not C because the liquid surface and droplet never come into contact. 
    If they did, the droplet and liquid surface will merge.

=== "Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics"

    Which of the following is part of Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics? (By Jed) <br> <br>

    1. When an electron is observed, its wavefunction will collapse to a point. 
    The position of this point is random and the probability of different locations is defined by the wavefunction. <br>
    2. The universe is non-deterministic. <br> 
    3. Each particle has a corressponding pilot wave that guides its motion. <br> <br>

    A. 1, 2 and 3 <br>
    B. 1 and 2 <br>
    C. 2 and 3 <br>
    D. Only 1 <br>
    E. Only 2 <br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **B**. 

    1 and 2 are correct. 3 is part of pilot-wave theory.

=== "Interference"

    In a double slit experiment, when we use a particle counter (By Ziming)
    to observe the particles passing through one of the slits, what happens
    to the pattern observed on the screen (for both electrons and walking droplets)?<br> <br>

    A. The pattern remains the same for both electrons and walking droplets.<br>
    B. The pattern is destroyed for walking droplets but remains the same for electrons.<br>
    C. The pattern is destroyed for electrons but remains the same for walking droplets.<br>
    D. The pattern is destroyed for both electrons and walking droplets.<br> <br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **C**
    
    When we observe the electron, we are forcing it to pass
    through one of the slits, meaning that it cannot pass through
    both slits "simultaneously". Thus, it cannot interfere with itself
    and the interference pattern is destroyed. However, this does not
    apply to walking droplets since the pilot waves pass through both 
    slits rather than the particle.

=== "Orbits"

    Walking droplets and electrons both have discrete orbital radii,
    but the reasons are very different, what is the difference?(By Ziming)<br> <br>

    A. Electrons are much smaller than walking droplets.<br>
    B. Electrons have to be treated as quantum, while the motion of droplets are in the classical regime.<br>
    C. Electrons occupying discrete orbital radii is a property of the electron itself, while the droplets occupy discrete oribtal radii because the force between droplets is only atractive for certain distances.<br>
    D. All of the above.<br> <br>
    

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **D**

    A causes B, which causes C. Thus, all are true.

=== "Wall"

    What causes a wall that stops the bouncing droplet?(By Oliver)<br> <br>
    A: A physical piece of material that is fully submerged in the silicon oil<br>
    B: A physical piece of material that is only above the surface of the silicon oil<br>
    C: Nothing, it just appears randomly and can not be controlled<br>
    D: None of the above<br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **A**

    The piece of material causes a decrease in depth which causes a wall that stops the droplet from passing through

=== "Tunneling"

    Which of the following is a result of quantum tunneling?(By Oliver)<br> <br>
    A: A ball goes through a tunnel in a hill to reach the other side<br>
    B: An electron that manages to go through a potential barrier it should not be able to<br>
    C: A ball that manages to appear on the other side of a hill it should not be able to<br>
    D: None of the above<br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **B**

    Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon of quantum particle that manages to go through an energy barrier
    that it should not be able to normally. The electron is the quantum particle and the potential barrier
    is the energy barrier for the electron.
