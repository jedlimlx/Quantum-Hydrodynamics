=== "Droplet Bouncing?"

    Why does the droplet get repelled by the liquid surface, allowing it to bounce? (By Jed) <br> <br>

    A. The air layer between the droplet and liquid surface is compressed, resulting in a restoring force that 
    pushes the droplet away from the surface <br>
    B. The droplet and liquid are electrostatically charged, resulting in a repulsive force <br>
    C. The vibrating liquid surface hits the droplet, exerting a normal force that pushes the droplet away from the surface <br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **A**. 

    Its not B because the droplet and liquid are not charged. Its not C because the liquid surface and droplet never come into contact. 
    If they did, the droplet and liquid surface will merge.

=== "Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics"

    Which of the following is part of Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics? <br> <br>

    1. When an electron is observed, its wavefunction will collapse to a point. 
    The position of this point is random and the probability of different locations is defined by the wavefunction. <br>
    2. The universe is non-deterministic. <br> 
    3. Each particle has a corressponding pilot wave that guides its motion. <br> <br>

    A. 1, 2 and 3 <br>
    B. 1 and 2 <br>
    C. 2 and 3 <br>
    D. Only 1 <br>
    E. Only 2 <br>

=== "Solution"

    The answer is **B**. 

    1 and 2 are correct. 3 is part of pilot-wave theory.
