# Quantum Hydrodynamics

This is a video of what happens to a droplet of silicon oil when it is placed on a vertically vibrating bath.

It bounces up and down on the surface of the liquid bath rather than coalescing with the liquid. Furthermore, the droplet
can even be seen "walking" and moving randomly across the liquid surface! Why?

Let's find out!
