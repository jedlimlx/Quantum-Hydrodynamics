# Introduction

As previously mentioned, the droplet bounces up and down when placed on a vertically vibrating bath and exhibits some fascinating behaviour. 
In this section, we will find out why!

## Air Layer

This shows the droplet falling down onto a stationary liquid bath. When the drop falls down, the air in between the droplet and 
liquid is pushed out. When they droplet and liquid come into contact, droplet merges with the liquid.

Now, the bath is vibrated up and down. This makes the air between the droplet and liquid escape more slowly. 
Thus, the droplet gets closer to the liquid bath, the air between the droplet and liquid is compressed because it can't escape 
and exerts a force on the droplet that stops it from getting closer.

Hence, the droplet is repelled and can seemingly "bounce" on the liquid surface.

## Faraday Waves

Before we go into the other wacky behaviour of the droplet, we need to understand the Faraday instability. It was first described by
Micheal Faraday in 1831. It occurs when a liquid bath is vibrated up and down. When the vibration is large enough, standing waves can be seen 
on the water surface. You may have seen this phenomenon before with water in a metal tray. When you hit the metal tray, you might have seen 
standing waves on the water surface. A video of these waves are shown below.

Let's now look at the waves that are formed on the liquid surface when the droplet impacts it. 
When the droplet impacts the surface of the liquid, the same force that pushes the droplet upwards, 
acts on the liquid surface. Just like how ripples are formed when a rock falls into water, similar ripples are formed
on the liquid surface.

While these waves are not Faraday waves, their lifespan is affected by the Faraday instability. As the amplitude of
the vibration increases towards the critical amplitude, the rate at which the waves formed by the droplet decay is lower. This means that
these waves persist on the liquid surface for a longer period of time because the liquid surface is more unstable.

## Path Memory

This explains one of intriguing aspect of this system - hysteresis. If you aren't familiar with the term, hysteresis means
that the system's current state depends on its history.

In this system, the droplet's past trajectory can affect its current position since the waves generated from previous bounces
may not have fully decayed when the droplet next contacts the surface. This will slightly change the direction of the force imparted
to the droplet. Hence, the droplet could take unpredictable trajectories on the liquid bath. This phenomenon is known as
"path-memory". As expected, this effect is more prominent when the liquid bath is vibrated more.
