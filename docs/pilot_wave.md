# Pilot Wave Theory

Now, I'm sure, you're dying to know what causes all these quantum behaviours of the droplet. Before we go into that,
let's talk a bit about interpretations of quantum mechanics.

## Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

While the mathematics and equations of quantum mechanics have been rigorously tested,
there is no consensus on how abstract concepts such as the quantum wavefunction translate into what is actually occuring on the quantum scale. 
This has lead to the creation of many conflicting interpretations of quantum mechanics that describes the equations governing the
quantum world corresponds to what is actually happening.

## Copenhagen Interpretation
The influential and widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen Interpretation which is attributed
the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. You have learnt about quantum mechanics, you would have been taught this interpretation.

At its core, the Copenhagen Interpretation has the idea that quantum mechanics is fundamentally indeterministic. It treats
the quantum wavefunction (which describes the possible positions of the particle and their corresponding probability) as 
not just being a mathematical abstraction but instead as something that actually exists. When a particle is observed, it 
states that the wavefunction collapses to a point.

## Pilot Wave Theory
Now, let us take a look at pilot wave theory which is a different interpretation of quantum mechanics and explains the 
quantum behaviour of the droplet.

Pilot wave theory was created by Louis De Broglie in his 1924. It is a deterministic theory. 
While in the Copenhagen interpretation, they are viewed as the same thing in the wave-particle duality, in pilot-wave 
theory, they are separate. Pilot-wave theory states that the particle is influenced by its interactions with the wave-function, 
similar to the interactions of the droplet and the waves on the liquid surface. However, in pilot-wave theory, the wave-function is
hidden and we cannot see or measure it. This means that to us, the motion of the particle is seemingly stochastic and random 
due to our ignorance of the true state of reality. Nevertheless, the universe is still determinstic because if we did 
know the wave-function, we can perfectly describe the motion of the particle.

## So, why is it analogous?
Having drawn these parallels to pilot wave theory, I'm sure it is clear why the system of the droplet and vibrating liquid bath
is analogous to some quantum systems. The wave excited by the droplet is effectively the wavefunction in pilot-wave theory which
guides the path of the droplet. It interacts with surrounding objects such as the slits used in diffraction and double-slit interference, hence
allowing the positions of many droplets to show interference patterns.
