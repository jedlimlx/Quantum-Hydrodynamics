The behaviour of walking droplets passing through small slits is similar to the diffraction and interference observed for light or small particles. Before we dive deeper into the phenomenon, I must clarify what \"slits\" mean in the context of waves and walking droplets. As discussed in insert link when Oliver is done , a \"wall\" is made by making the fluid shallower for a small region. The waves will have a more difficult time travelling through this shallower region and tends to be reflected back. We can make \"slits\" in a similar way, by pasting a thin strip at the bottom of the container, but leaving a small hole in the center. Now we can explore some interesting things that happen when the droplets pass through a slit, or an arrangement of slits. Diffraction insert video of droplet diffracting When a droplet \"walks\" towards a small slit, it doesn't just pass straight through. After it passes through the slit, its direction will change in a seemingly random manner. When scientists observed the path of a hundred droplets that walk through the slit, they found that the final direction of the droplet is not actually random, it's actually similar to the diffraction pattern observed for light! insert picture of diffraction graph Diffraction is observed when waves pass through a small slit. The wave will tend to spread out after passing through the slit, following a certain pattern. It is commonly demonstrated in schools using light rays shot through a thin slit, where the light rays will spread out and form a unique pattern on a screen, known as a diffraction pattern. insert image of light diffraction pattern Early on, diffraction was only observed with waves, such as light and sound. However, in 1924, Louis de Broglie made the bold claim that particles could behave like waves, in the same way that Planck and Einstein hypothesized that waves, such as light, can behave like particles. His claims were not backed by direct experimental evidence when he published his thesis, but he was proven right when scientists found that electrons can also be diffracted! So how can electrons, and bouncing droplets, behave like waves? And what is the similarity between the two? De Broglie actually hypothesized that particles not only behave like waves, but they coexist with a wave, even though we can only observe the particle. The particle influences the properties of the wave, while the wave \"guides\" the particle. Even though this theory is no longer the most commonly accepted model of quantum physics, it can explain most quantum effects. With this model, we can see that it's not the particle that diffracts but the wave that accompanies it. Even though the particle never touches the barriers on either side of the slit, the guiding wave does and is reflected by the boundaries. The interference between the reflected wave and original wave causes the wave pattern near the slit to be almost random, so it guides the particle to move in a random direction. It turns out that the final direction of particles is not completely random, but follows a probability distribution. This is due to the constructive and destructive interference of the guiding waves causing certain directions to be favored. Interference I don't think there is a video on double slit, but if there is it goes here An even more interesting phenomenon occurs when the droplets walk through one of the slits in a double slit setup. Again, the droplet gets diffracted as it passes through the slit, but the probability distribution of the final directions the droplet travels in is different from when there is only one slit! insert graph here As it turns out, the probability distribution is more similar to the double slit interference pattern for light waves. The double slit experiment is also a common demonstration in schools, where a laser beam is shot through an opaque sheet with 2 small slits. The two slits function as individual sources and an interference pattern is observed on the screen, consisting of alternating bright and dark fringes, when the waves from the 2 slits interfere constructively and destructively respectively. The double slit interference requires waves from both slits, but the droplet only passes through one slit, so how can an interferences pattern be observed? When scientists observed the behaviour of the waves as the particle passed through the slit, they observed that even though the particle only passes through one slit, its guiding wave actually passes through both slits. The waves from both slits will then interfere and guide the particle to regions of constructive interference.","title":"Interference and Diffraction"},{"location":"double_slit/#interference-and-diffraction","text":"Aside from quantum tunnelling, the droplets can also exhibit quantum-like effects when passing through small slits.

In this section, we will find out why! Air Layer insert some sick animation This shows the droplet falling down onto a stationary liquid bath. When the drop falls down, the air in between the droplet and liquid is pushed out. When they droplet and liquid come into contact, droplet merges with the liquid. insert 2nd sick animation Now, the bath is vibrated up and down. This makes the air between the droplet and liquid escape more slowly. Thus, the droplet gets closer to the liquid bath, the air between the droplet and liquid is compressed because it can't escape and exerts a force on the droplet that stops it from getting closer. Hence, the droplet is repelled and can seemingly \"bounce\" on the liquid surface. Faraday Waves Before we go into the other wacky behaviour of the droplet, we need to understand the Faraday instability. It was first described by Micheal Faraday in 1831. It occurs when a liquid bath is vibrated up and down. When the vibration is large enough, standing waves can be seen on the water surface. You may have seen this phenomenon before with water in a metal tray. When you hit the metal tray, you might have seen standing waves on the water surface. A video of these waves are shown below. insert video of Faraday waves Let's now look at the waves that are formed on the liquid surface when the droplet impacts it. When the droplet impacts the surface of the liquid, the same force that pushes the droplet upwards, acts on the liquid surface. Just like how ripples are formed when a rock falls into water, similar ripples are formed on the liquid surface. While these waves are not Faraday waves, their lifespan is affected by the Faraday instability. As the amplitude of the vibration increases towards the critical amplitude, the rate at which the waves formed by the droplet decay is lower. This means that these waves persist on the liquid surface for a longer period of time because the liquid surface is more unstable. Path Memory This explains one of intriguing aspect of this system - hysteresis. If you aren't familiar with the term, hysteresis means that the system's current state depends on its history. In this system, the droplet's past trajectory can affect its current position since the waves generated from previous bounces may not have fully decayed when the droplet next contacts the surface. This will slightly change the direction of the force imparted to the droplet. Hence, the droplet could take unpredictable trajectories on the liquid bath. This phenomenon is known as \"path-memory\". As expected, this effect is more prominent when the liquid bath is vibrated more. Is this chaos?
