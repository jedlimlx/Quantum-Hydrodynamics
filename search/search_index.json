In this section, we will find out why! Air Layer First, consider the case in which the bath is not vibrating. insert some sick animation We see that the drop falls down and the air in between the droplet and liquid is pushed out. When the droplet and liquid come into contact, droplet merges with the liquid. insert 2nd sick animation Now, the bath is vibrated up and down. This reduces the rate at which the air can escape from between the droplet and the liquid bath. As a result, when the droplet gets closer to the liquid bath, the air between the droplet and liquid is compressed and exerts a restoring force. This results in the droplet being repelled and seemingly \"bounce\" on the liquid surface. Faraday Waves Before we go into the other wacky behaviour of the droplet, we need to understand the Faraday instability. It was first described by Micheal Faraday in 1831. It occures when a liquid bath is vibrated up and down beyond a critical amplitude, resulting in the formation of non-linear standing waves on the liquid surface. A video of some Faraday waves are shown below. insert video of Faraday waves Now, we can understand the waves that are induced on the surface of the liquid when the droplet impacts it and their behaviour. When the droplet impacts the surface of the liquid, the same force originating from the compressed air pushing up the droplet upwards, causes the liquid surface to be deformed. This results in the formation of waves on the liquid surface. While these waves are not Faraday waves, their rate of decay can be described by the Faraday instability. As the amplitude of the vibration increases towards the critical amplitude, the rate at which the waves formed by the droplet decay is lower. This means that these waves persist on the liquid surface for a longer period of time as the fluid surface is more unstable. Path Memory This explains one of intriguing aspect of this system - hystersis. If you aren't familar with the term, hystersis means that the system's current state depends on its history. In this system, the droplet's past trajectory can affect its current position since the waves generated from previous bounces may not have fully decay when the droplet next contacts the surface. This will slightly changes the direction of the force impacted on the droplet, resulting in the droplet taking unpredictable trajectories on the liquid bath. As expected, this path-memory effect is more prominent when the vibration amplitude of the liquid bath is larger. Is this chaos?
