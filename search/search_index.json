The behaviour of walking droplets passing through small slits is similar to the diffraction and interference observed for light or small particles. Before we dive deeper into the phenomenon, we must clarify what \"slits\" mean in the context of waves and walking droplets. As discussed in Quantum Tunneling , a \"wall\" is made by making the fluid shallower for a small region. The waves will have a more difficult time travelling through this shallower region and tends to be reflected back. We can make \"slits\" in a similar way, by pasting a thin strip at the bottom of the container, but leaving a small hole in the center.

Bush, \u201cPilot-wave hydrodynamics,\u201d Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 47, 269\u2013292 (2015). When a droplet \"walks\" towards a small slit, it doesn't just pass straight through. After it passes through the slit, its direction will change in a seemingly random manner. When scientists observed the path of a hundred droplets that walk through the slit, they found that the final direction of the droplet is not actually random, it's actually similar to the diffraction pattern observed for light! Taken from J. W. M. Bush, \u201cPilot-wave hydrodynamics,\u201d Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 47, 269\u2013292 (2015). Diffraction is observed when waves pass through a small slit. The wave will tend to spread out after passing through the slit, following a certain pattern. It is commonly demonstrated in schools using light rays shot through a thin slit, where the light rays will spread out and form a unique pattern on a screen, known as a diffraction pattern. Taken from https://www.a-levelphysicstutor.com/wav-light-diffr.php Early on, diffraction was only observed with waves, such as light and sound. However, in 1924, Louis de Broglie made the bold claim that particles could behave like waves, in the same way that Planck and Einstein hypothesized that waves, such as light, can behave like particles. His claims were not backed by direct experimental evidence when he published his thesis, but he was proven right when scientists found that electrons can also be diffracted! So how can electrons, and bouncing droplets, behave like waves? And what is the similarity between the two? De Broglie actually hypothesized that particles not only behave like waves, but they coexist with a wave, even though we can only observe the particle. The particle influences the properties of the wave, while the wave \"guides\" the particle. Even though this theory is no longer the most commonly accepted model of quantum physics, it can explain most quantum effects. With this model, we can see that it's not the particle that diffracts but the wave that accompanies it. Even though the particle never touches the barriers on either side of the slit, the guiding wave does and is reflected by the boundaries. The interference between the reflected wave and original wave causes the wave pattern near the slit to be almost random, so it guides the particle to move in a random direction. It turns out that the final direction of particles is not completely random, but follows a probability distribution. This is due to the constructive and destructive interference of the guiding waves causing certain directions to be favored. Interference An even more interesting phenomenon occurs when the droplets walk through one of the slits in a double slit setup.

In this section, we will find out why! Air Layer This shows the droplet falling down onto a stationary liquid bath. When the droplet falls down, the air in between the droplet and the liquid is pushed out. When the droplet and the liquid come into contact, the droplet merges with the liquid. Now, the bath is vibrated up and down. This makes the air between the droplet and the liquid escape more slowly. Thus, when the droplet gets closer to the liquid bath, the air between the droplet and the liquid is compressed because it can't escape and exerts a force on the droplet that stops it from getting closer. Hence, the droplet is repelled and can seemingly \"bounce\" on the liquid surface. Faraday Waves Before we go into the other wacky behaviour of the droplet, we need to understand the Faraday instability. It was first described by Michael Faraday in 1831. It occurs when a liquid bath is vibrated up and down. When the vibration is large enough, standing waves can be seen on the water surface. You may have seen this phenomenon before with water in a metal tray. When you hit the metal tray, you might have seen standing waves on the water surface. A video of these waves are shown below. Video taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jsevcyP9g Let's now look at the waves that are formed on the liquid surface when the droplet impacts it. When the droplet impacts the surface of the liquid, the same force that pushes the droplet upwards, acts on the liquid surface. Just like how ripples are formed when a rock falls into water, similar ripples are formed on the liquid surface. While these waves are not Faraday waves, their lifespan is affected by the Faraday instability. As the amplitude of the vibration increases towards the critical amplitude, the rate at which the waves formed by the droplet decay is lower. This means that these waves persist on the liquid surface for a longer period of time because the liquid surface is more unstable. Path Memory This explains one of the intriguing aspects of this system - hysteresis. If you aren't familiar with the term, hysteresis means that the system's current state depends on its history. In this system, the droplet's past trajectory can affect its current position since the waves generated from previous bounces may not have fully decayed when the droplet next contacts the surface. This will slightly change the direction of the force imparted to the droplet. Hence, the droplet could take unpredictable trajectories on the liquid bath. This phenomenon is known as \"path-memory\". As expected, this effect is more prominent when the liquid bath is vibrated more.

Fluid Mech. 47, 269\u2013292 (2015). Now, you may wonder - if the system is symmetric, why does the droplet walk in some cases, rather than always bouncing on the same spot? Well, this is caused by the system becoming more unstable as the bath is vibrated more vigorously. These instabilities arise from the transient waves (shown in the uneven water surface in the video) created by the droplet taking longer to decay as explained previously. As a result, the force exerted on the droplet as it bounces off the water surface is no longer directly vertical. Thus, the bouncing of the droplet becomes unstable and the droplet will begin to \"walk\". When the bath is vibrated even more vigorously, the droplet begins to walk not in a straight line but move around in an unpredictable matter. We call this phase of the droplet's motion, \"chaotic\". This means that its motion is sensitive to initial conditions. However, note that the droplet's motion is still completely deterministic!

Before we go into that, let's talk a bit about interpretations of quantum mechanics. Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics While the mathematics and equations of quantum mechanics have been rigorously tested, there is no consensus on how abstract concepts such as the quantum wavefunction translate into what is actually occuring on the quantum scale. This has led to the creation of many conflicting interpretations of quantum mechanics that describe how the equations governing the quantum world corresponds to what is actually happening. Copenhagen Interpretation The influential and widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen Interpretation which is attributed to the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. If you have learnt about quantum mechanics, you would have been taught this interpretation. At its core, the Copenhagen Interpretation states that quantum mechanics is fundamentally indeterministic. It treats the quantum wavefunction (which describes the possible positions of the particle and their corresponding probability) as not just being a mathematical abstraction but instead as something that actually exists. When a particle is observed, it states that the wavefunction collapses to a point. Pilot Wave Theory Now, let us take a look at pilot wave theory which is a different interpretation of quantum mechanics and explains the quantum behaviour of the droplet. Pilot wave theory was created by Louis De Broglie in 1924. It is a deterministic theory. While in the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction and the particle are viewed as the same thing in the wave-particle duality, in pilot-wave theory, they are separate. Pilot-wave theory states that the particle is influenced by its interactions with the wave-function, similar to the interactions of the droplet and the waves on the liquid surface. However, in pilot-wave theory, the wave-function is hidden and we cannot see or measure it. This means that to us, the motion of the particle is seemingly stochastic and random due to our ignorance of the true state of reality. Nevertheless, the universe is still determinstic because if we did know the wave-function, we can perfectly describe the motion of the particle. So, why is it analogous? Having drawn these parallels to pilot wave theory, it is clear why the system of the droplet and vibrating liquid bath is analogous to some quantum systems. The wave excited by the droplet is effectively the wavefunction in pilot-wave theory which guides the path of the droplet. It interacts with surrounding objects such as the slits used in diffraction and double-slit interference, hence allowing the positions of many droplets to show interference patterns.

When a particle is observed, it states that the wavefunction collapses to a point.","title":"Copenhagen Interpretation"},{"location":"pilot_wave/#pilot-wave-theory_1","text":"Now, let us take a look at pilot wave theory which is a different interpretation of quantum mechanics and explains the quantum behaviour of the droplet. Pilot wave theory was created by Louis De Broglie in 1924. It is a deterministic theory. While in the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction and the particle are viewed as the same thing in the wave-particle duality, in pilot-wave theory, they are separate. Pilot-wave theory states that the particle is influenced by its interactions with the wave-function, similar to the interactions of the droplet and the waves on the liquid surface. However, in pilot-wave theory, the wave-function is hidden and we cannot see or measure it. This means that to us, the motion of the particle is seemingly stochastic and random due to our ignorance of the true state of reality. Nevertheless, the universe is still determinstic because if we did know the wave-function, we can perfectly describe the motion of the particle.","title":"Pilot Wave Theory"},{"location":"pilot_wave/#so-why-is-it-analogous","text":"Having drawn these parallels to pilot wave theory, it is clear why the system of the droplet and vibrating liquid bath is analogous to some quantum systems. The wave excited by the droplet is effectively the wavefunction in pilot-wave theory which guides the path of the droplet. It interacts with surrounding objects such as the slits used in diffraction and double-slit interference, hence allowing the positions of many droplets to show interference patterns.","title":"So, why is it analogous?"},{"location":"pilot_wave/#recap","text":"Demonstration videos in this video are taken from Supplementary Material of J.

Interference Solution In a double slit experiment, when we use a particle counter (By Ziming) to observe the particles passing through one of the slits, what happens to the pattern observed on the screen (for both electrons and walking droplets)? A. The pattern remains the same for both electrons and walking droplets. B. The pattern is destroyed for walking droplets but remains the same for electrons. C. The pattern is destroyed for electrons but remains the same for walking droplets. D. The pattern is destroyed for both electrons and walking droplets.

Looking at the short animation above, we can see that normally, in classical mechanics, which describes the physics in our daily lives, a ball cannot roll past a hill without having enough energy to reach the tip of the hill. We call the hill an energy barrier as the ball needs to possess a certain amount of energy to cross it. Looking at another short animation above, we can see in quantum mechanics, when we shoot an electron at a potential barrier, which acts as an energy barrier for the electron, we would expect the electron to be stopped by the potential barrier. Indeed, that is what is observed most of the time when such experiments are done. However, something similar to the short animation above can happen in real life at quantum scale. Due to the quirks of quantum mechanics, sometimes the electron that is supposed to be stopped at the potential barrier, tunnels to the other side of the potential barrier. This means that the electron had just managed to go straight through the potential barrier. This is something that would have been impossible in classical mechanics but has a small but finite probability to happen in quantum mechanics. Thus, this is named the quantum tunnelling phenomenon in quantum mechanics, signifying that the electron had \"dug\" a \"tunnel\" to go past the energy barrier. Interestingly, the droplets can exhibit behaviours almost identical to regular quantum tunneling as shown above. As it turns out, by fully submerging a piece of material (which can be plastic, metal, or anything that is solid) into the small pool of silicon oil, we have managed to create the energy barrier, which you can imagine as a wall, that the droplet would bounce off most of the time, but is able to pass through in some rare circumstances. Now we can go into the details of this behaviour and why it is very similar to regular quantum tunneling. Wall So firstly, we will go over how fully submerging a piece of material would cause the formation of a \"wall\" for the oil droplet. In order to understand that, let's first look at the equation below. $$ c = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{k}\\tanh{hk}} $$ This equation describes the wave velocity of the wave, where c is the wave speed, g is Earth's gravitational constant, k is the wavenumber and h is the depth that the wave is traveling above. In our scenario, k and g would stay constant, thus we would have the following relation. $$ c \\propto \\sqrt{\\tanh{hk}} $$ When we fully submerge a piece of material, the depth of the water decreases, which means a decrease in h in the equation above, thus a decrease in c, which is the wave speed. Whenever the speed of a wave changes, it is always associated with refraction. When refraction is occurs, partial reflection almost always follows. Thus, the wave, which both influences and is influenced by the droplet, is partially reflected at where the piece of material is present at. Since the wave also influences the droplet, often the droplet would be bounced back at the location of the piece of material if it does not have sufficient kinetic energy to go over the area created by the material, thus creating a \"wall\" for the droplet. Similarity to Tunneling So how is this phenomenon almost identical to quantum tunneling? Experiments have been done and the results have shown that the probability of a droplet going over a wall decreases exponentially with increasing width of the wall, which translates to increasing width of the energy barrier. This is exactly the same as the probability of an electron passing through a potential barrier, which also decreases exponentially with increasing width of the potential barrier, which is also the energy barrier. Another similarity is that there has been no pattern observed in the conditions required for the droplet to pass over the \"wall\" if it does not have the kinetic energy required for it to go over the wall. It is completely probabilistic. The two main characteristics of quantum tunneling are both observed in this phenomenon, thus we can conclude that this phenomenon is almost identical to quantum tunneling.
